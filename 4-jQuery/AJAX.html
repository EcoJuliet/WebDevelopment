           <p> AJAX allows me to get content  from my server within my webpage (for example, a click), and do something <em>without refreshing the page.</em></p> 
        
            <p>One slight downside of it, is that <strong> we can't use it on local files.</strong></p>
            <p>So, AJAX doesn't work on files on your computer.</p>
            <p> jQuery is not critical for AJAX, but it makes it easier.</p>

            $.get("filename.txt", function(data) {
                
                alert(data); // alerts the  content of filename.txt
                
                
            }) // gets content from filename. Uses a callback function to do the thing.
            // uses a variable "data" on the function call.
            
            // problems:
/*            Doesn't give you an option or message if "get" fails. That can happen on mobile if someone loses connection.
            Other options would be: give a message in case the file doesn't get loaded, or, better yet, just do the action later.
