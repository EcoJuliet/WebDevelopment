    <p> Regex is AWESOME.<br>
        Misterious and confusing too!<br>
        REGEX is used to check if someone entered numbers/letters or anything like that in forms<br>
        </p>
   
        <p></p>
        <script type="text/javascript">

                //first we define our REGEX
            
            var  regex = /is/; // it's used with slashes. 
            
            var string = "Regex is great!";
            
            
            // to match these, I use the match function on jQuery (althought it can be used with pure JS)
            
            var result = string.match(regex); // uses 1 parameter: the regex expression :) 
            //what it does is: "does the word (var regex) appear in the string (var string)?
            
            alert(result); // doesn't return TRUE OR FALSE. It returns what it finds.
            // if it doesn't find anything: it returns, null!
            
   /*         
            Regex is case sensitive:
            /great/ != /Great/
            
            To fix that, use the:
            
            /great/i -> "case Insenstive search"
            
            We can also look for things that appeear on the string more than once:
            
            /e/ -> returns "e", because "yes, it appears more than once"
            
            if I want to know HOW MANY times it appesar:
            
            /e/g -> global flag. Results in a array of "e"
